#### Abstract: 
Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) studies make use of modern technologies such as smartphones to repeatedly sample subjects’ behavior and state in real time. These studies produce intensively mea- sured longitudinal data with large numbers of observations per subject, and are well suited to address research questions in psychology and public health while assuring a degree of ecological validity. This paper highlights two analytical approaches to EMA data. Mixed-e↵ects location-scale jointly model the mean and variance of the response variable while accounting for individual heterogeneity. Time-varying e↵ects model on the other hand estimates dynamic, nonlinear associations between variables by estimat- ing coecients as functions of time. Theoretical and analytical properties of these methods are described alongside simulation studies and real data analysis examples to illustrate their strengths and weaknesses in practice.
